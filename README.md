# ToDoApp

This project of a simple todoapp is based on a udemy course (Samuraj Programowania); however I have made a couple changes.

## Start the project

1. Copy the repo\
2. Type in terminal npm start in the project's root folder\
3. Commands: --add='task', --remove='task name or task id', or --list\

### What did I change?

-Function --add automatically provides random id for each task\
-Added feature to remove tasks based on their id\
-Remove function is implemented in a cleaner code\
